Each animal can have several friends among other animals from the zoo. Every day each animal
randomly loses one friend (if there are any) and gets from zero to one new friend. If ​ **A** ​ is a friend of ​ **B**
then ​ **B** ​is a friend of ​ **A** ​automatically. At the beginning: nobody has friends.

**Task Description**

Create console or simple GUI java application, to provide following functionality:

    1. Display list of all animals with their properties and friends' names.
    2. Live one day. Every animal attempts to break/establish friendship as described above. Print all
       changes to console. For example "Dog one has lost friendship with Chicken one; Dog one has
       established a friendship with Parrot two."
    3. Exit.
    
Programming language: Java (JDK 1.8+). No third party libraries (JUnit is OK), any IDE.

Write short design document describing most important aspects.

If you think some part of the test assignment is unclear, don't worry. Decide for yourself what would be
a logical or fun thing to do, and shortly explain it in your design document.
Object-oriented design and high-quality coding will be deciding factors.
